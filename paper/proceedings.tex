  recommendations on writing for the worldwide SIGCHI
  readership. Please review this document even if you have submitted
  to SIGCHI conferences before, as some format details have changed
  relative to previous years. Abstracts should be about 150 words and

\section{Introduction}
% part and parcel of everyday life
Interaction with your personal mobile device is an individual daily routine. Devices are increasingly smart and have plenty of functions. As today's mobile devices vary highly in their dimensions, interaction has different levels of difficulties. One or two hands might be necessary for different tasks.\\
People have different hand sizes and tend to have different device sizes, although that might not be closely interlinked. Mobile touch interactions differ widely with hand and device size.\\
Besides mobility, personalization is an important aspect. Our smartphone can only be smart based on our personal information, like for example our residence, contacts and browsing habits.\\
Our hand size could be another personalization aspect and make our devices even smarter. If my device knows about my hand size, it could for instance adapt the layout to help us reaching the important interaction elements.\\
The paper is organized as follows ...

\subsection{Procedure}
% Studienaufbau
The participants have been invited to a 15 minute time slot to take part in our hand measurement study. They could receive credits or an amazon voucher for their participation. In order to allow the usage of their hand and touch data, they had to sign a letter of agreement.\\
At first, the participants hand dimensions were measured manually as described before. Their data was then entered directly into our app. The participants started with the radius task in a predetermined hand position. After that, the tasks came up in a random order according to a latin square. The participants were free in solving the tasks, except they were only allowed to use one hand. For the zooming tasks, participants were instructed to use the other hand as well or to leave the device on the table.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We came up with different challenges when investigating hand size and mobile touch interactions. In our study, it was hardly possible to determine the user's hand size from his mobile touch interactions during our tasks.\\
We could show a higher correlation between touch interaction and hand size when we determined the hand position. As this might be uncomfortable for users, the other tasks in our study were designed in such a way that hand position is free and left over to the user.\\
Further investigations should eventually determine hand positions in order to evaluate the user's hand size. As the most promising result we got was from our radius task, this could eventually be used to predict the user's hand size. Knowing about the user's hand size could then enhance mobile interaction. Our dev

\item weitere Daten angucken und evaluieren

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you
% submit:

% http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2149854/how-to-manually-equalize-columns-

% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
