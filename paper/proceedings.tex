\section{Introduction}
% part and parcel of everyday life
Interaction with your personal mobile device is an individual daily routine. Devices are increasingly smart and have plenty of functions. As today's mobile devices vary highly in their dimensions, interaction has different levels of difficulties. One or two hands might be necessary for different tasks.\\
People have different hand sizes and tend to have different device sizes, although that might not be closely interlinked. Mobile touch interactions differ widely with hand and device size.\\
Besides mobility, personalization is an important aspect. Our smartphone can only be smart based on our personal information, like for example our residence, contacts and browsing habits.\\ %TO DO quelle?!
Research shows another important personalization factor: hand size. What has been investigated a lot so far is the touch behavior of different users (e.g. \cite{parhi2006target}, \cite{buschek2015touchml}). An example is touch precision in relation to the user's hand size \cite{parhi2006target}. These and others show that hand size actually has an influence on mobile touch interactions. Our hand size could be another personalization aspect and make our devices even smarter. If my device knows about my hand size, it could for instance adapt the layout to help us reaching the important interaction elements.\\
This highly motivates our research. In our study, we were aiming at finding the backward conclusion from the user's touch input to his hand size as this could be used for further personalization on mobile devices.
%The paper is organized as follows. We start with an overview of related work. We present our study design and procedure before showing our results. We conclude with a discussion and an outlook to future work.

\section{Related Work}
Parhi et al. performed a study about the error rates and preferred positions of different sized targets on a screen. They found out that as the target's size increases the error rate and time to reach decreases. Users also preferred the middle of the screen in contrast to the upper left and lower right corner \cite{parhi2006target}. Another study by Karlson et al. also demonstrates that the middle of the screen is the easiest to reach for a user while reaching the corners is more time consuming \cite{karlson2006studies}. Since the target's position seems to be relevant for a user's performance, we also tested different target positions in our study. Buschek and Alt also took the hand size into consideration and discovered that users with smaller hands show a larger y-offset in the upper left corner but are more accurate in the lower area of the screen when trying to hit a target \cite{buschek2015touchml}. In this study only one hand dimension was measured. We chose to measure four different dimension in order to find the highest correlations. A different study by Balakrishnan et al. investigated users' satisfaction for different keyboards. They tried to find correlations between the satisfaction and the user's thumb length or circumference. The results show that the circumreference correlates with the satisfaction of the key size and space between the keys \cite{balakrishnan2008study}. In contrast to Balakrishnan et al. we investigated the hand size in total but not the thumb size itself. Bergstrom et al. defined a functional area which is the reachable region of a user's thumb without repositioning his hand. Smaller hands also show a lesser functional area \cite{bergstrom2014modeling}. As observed by Boring et al. users reposition their hand in order to reach certain areas of the screen \cite{boring2012fat}. These findings are interesting factors which we also took into consideration for our study by measuring the radius of the participant's thumb and including tasks with predefined and undefined hand positions.

\section{Study}
In order to find correlations between a user's hand size and his mobile touch interactions we implemented an android application to measure data for different interactions. 

\subsection{Study Design}
%Since we wanted the measured data to be as natural as possible we chose to investigate four main gestures which users have to perform regularly when operating a smartphone: tapping, swiping, scrolling and zooming. The latter was tested in two tasks which concludes in five tasks in total. The user was allowed to adapt his hand position while performing these tasks. At the beginning of our exploratory study it was unclear whether this natural behaviour could deliver any useful results at all. This is why we chose to add a sixth unnatural task for which the hand position was predetermined. The radius of the user's thumb was meausured while he was holding the phone next to the heel of the hand. The specific tasks were designed as followed:
The study design was within subjects so all participants performed the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Radius task:} The user was supposed to swipe a quarter circle from the right edge of the screen to the lower left
	\item{Tapping task:} The user was instructed to hit small crosses on the screen as pecisely as possible. 144 crosses appeared in an randomized order
	\item{Scrolling task:} The user had to scroll a list from top to bottom
	\item{Swiping task:} The user was supposed to swipe a slider from left to right. Four slider positions were tested: top, middle, bottom and diagonal
	\item{Maximum zooming task:} The user had to zoom a blue rectangle as far as possible with one zoom gesture
	\item{Frame zooming task:} The user was instructed to zoom a blue rectangle to fit into a frame. Three frame sizes were tested: small, medium and large. The user was allowed to execute multiple zoom gestures
\end{itemize}
%The phone we used for our study was the HTC one max with a screen size of 5.9 inches. The study design was within subjects so all participants performed all of the tasks. The first one always was the unnatural interaction followed by the rest in an randomized order. It was also neccessary to measure the participants' hands in order to compare the hand sizes to the measured data delivered by our application. We chose to measure the participants' hand length, width, total span (from thumb to pinky finger) and zooming span (from thumb to index finger) in order to have more options for possible correlations. 
We measured the participants' hand length, width, total span (from thumb to pinky finger) and zooming span (from thumb to index finger).

\end{figure*} 

\subsection{App}
The android application implemented for this study contained a screen for entering data about the user (hand measurements, age and gender). Before each task some instructions about the assignment were displayed. While performing the tasks, the application tracked different features which were stored into a database. These comprised of the x- and y- positions of the touch events and sensor data about acceleration, rotation and orientation. Task specific features were the number of scrolls, zooming span, timestamps etc. The phone we used for our study was the HTC one max with a screen size of 5.9 inches.

\subsection{Participants}
The 62 participants of this study were 36 males and 26 females between 18 and 36 years old. The average age was 24. Their hand lengths differred between 152 and 224 mm.

\subsection{Procedure}
% Studienaufbau, WIE
The participants have been invited to a 15 minute time slot to take part in our hand measurement study. They could receive credits or an amazon voucher for their participation. In order to allow the usage of their hand and touch data, they had to sign a letter of agreement.\\
At first, the participants hand dimensions were measured manually as described before. Their data was then entered directly into our app. The participants started with the radius task in a predetermined hand position. After that, the tasks came up in a randomized order according to a latin square. The participants were free in solving the tasks, except they were only allowed to use one hand. For the zooming tasks, participants were instructed to use the other hand as well or to leave the device on the table.

\section{Results}
=> das korreliert mit xy
To understand the results of our study we first have to look at the measured hand data. The correlation of the different hand measurements is not as high as a naive assumption would suggest. The weaker correlations are with the total-span and with the zoom-span which is most likely caused by the measurement technique. For the zoom-span the subjects had to press their hand on the table and the span was measured. Some pressed stronger than others and others were physically able to spread their fingers wider. The tighter (?) measurements were therefore the with and the length of the hand, which correlate more as a result (0.841, see Table \ref{handSizeCorrelations}). Therefore we decided to compare the results with all of the four measurements separately. All results can be found in Table \ref{allCorrelations}. A calculation of significance could not be done because this study is only exploratory. The highest correlation was measured in the artificial Radius task. Participants with a bigger hand, a bigger Zoom Span in particular, were able to reach further to the left side of the screen, which is equivalent to a small X value, as we see in figure \ref{plotRadius}.
Another interesting result is the number of scrolls the participants needed to scroll to the end of the list in the scrolling task. Subjects with a wider hand needed less scrolls here. While observing the task operated by the participants we could notice that most subjects pushed the list and then waited a short moment until the list slowed down spinning. But some subjects just dragged the list and did not push the list at all, which is how the top outliers in figure \ref{plotScrolling} can be explained.
Another interesting plot is from the zooming task, where the subjects had to perform the widest zoom gesture they could. Although it was expected to get the highest correlation with the zooming span of the participants hands, it actually is the lowest and the best is with the width of the hand. It's important to know that most participants were able to perform a bigger zooming gesture than the devices screen. Looking at the plot (figure \ref{plotZooming}) we see that not all the recorded data is plausible because the span of the lowest point is around 5cm. Removing these points increases the correlation up to ???.

\subsection{Machine Learning}
After identifying the values with high correlation to any of the user's hand dimensions, we applied machine learning techniques in order to predict small and big hands from the measured data.\\
At first, the user's data was sorted by hand length and filtered in such a way that around 20\% of the biggest and the smallest hand sizes are in our data for machine learning, which makes 12 users of each class and a total of 24 data sets.\\
The feature set was built upon the values with the highest correlation, which are the following as shown before:\\ scrolling number, radius minimum X, taps 1/4 screen derivation, taps 1/4 screen orientation, zooming maximum span. These features where labeled with 'B' and 'S' for the 12 biggest and the 12 smallest user hands.\\
With this data set, a 10-fold cross validation was performed. As classifier, a Random Forest with default parameters was applied.\footnote{\url{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html\#random-forests}} We could achieve a score of 0.75 with this data set.\\
Using single features of this data set for a cross validation, the features taps 1/4 screen orientation (0.675) and radius minimum X (0.65) reach the highest score and seem to influence the overall result most. This shows a high potential for predicting the user's hand size from touch interaction. Once again, there is a big advantage in the result with predetermined hand position. To predict the users hand size properly, tasks with fixed hand position may be used for measurement.

\section{Discussion}

------------------Sarah ----------------------------------
\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We came up with different challenges when investigating hand size and mobile touch interactions. In our study, it was hardly possible to determine the user's hand size from his mobile touch interactions during our tasks.\\
We could show a higher correlation between touch interaction and hand size when we determined the hand position. As this might be uncomfortable for users, the other tasks in our study were designed in such a way that hand position is free and left over to the user. It turned out that machine learning techniques can help to predict the user's hand size but once more a fixed hand position delivers a higher score.\\
Further investigations should eventually determine hand positions in order to evaluate the user's hand size. As the most promising result we got was from our radius task, this interaction could eventually be used to predict the user's hand size.\\ 
%hier nochmal results zusammen fassen?!
Knowing about the user's hand size could then enhance mobile interaction. Another personalization aspect could be established through hand dimensions. If our mobile devices know about our hand sizes, they could adapt the user interfaces in order to facilitate the interaction. Navigation bars and other important UI Elements could be moved to make them more reachable. Thereby, our device would be even smarter in adapting to out personal needs.
